### What you'll learn

The objective of this module is to provide a fundamental understanding of data analysis. The course proceeds in 3 parts, following the Data Science Process:

*   Obtain and clean the data: we will teach you how to obtain, clean, and process data from different sources such as scraped web pages, spreadsheets, APIs, and documents.
    
*   Exploratory Data Analysis: we develop your skills in pre-modeling and post-modeling exploratory data analysis and visualization. This part is all about understanding your data.
    
*   Modeling: We choose some very specific models to cover, from the perspective of teaching techniques which are generalizable to any models. Thus we will cover classification and recommendation engines. Weâ€™ll also cover similarity and PCA, as a way of understanding structure in your data and the models you ran on them.
